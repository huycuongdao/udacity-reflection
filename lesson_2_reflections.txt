What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A .git folder will be created in a directory and it wrap up all the files.
	You have to do this if you want to work with git. If you delete the .git folder (it is hidden from you),
	you will not be able to work with git any more
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area will track your file if it is modified. You have to be in staging area to commit your files.
